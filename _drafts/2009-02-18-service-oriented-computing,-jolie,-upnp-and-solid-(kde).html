Most of the times, when I speak with someone who isn't familiar with Service-Oriented Computing (SOC), I have first to explain what SOC is, why SOC was born and, most importantly, what SOC can do for us. This is natural, as SOC is currently under heavy research all around the world and most SOC-related technologies are present only in big enterprise environments and are usually very expensive for companies to adopt (because they are complicated). Consider that this is just a rough summary of the situation and the SOC world is constantly evolving.<br /><br />Given the situation, I think it is important to post about what SOC can do for us through pragmatic examples. This post is the first of a series about disparate arguments related to SOC. Here I will speak about UPnP, Jolie and Solid (KDE).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org">Jolie</a> enters in the current SOC scenario with the ambitious objective to make SOC available to anyone. It is open-source and cross-platform; it offers a reference implementation; it is lightweight and easy to understand w.r.t. other major orchestration languages (languages based upon the SOC paradigm and focused on the creation and composition of other services).<br /><br />A library to bridge Qt/KDE to Jolie is currently being developed by KÃ©vin Ottens.
