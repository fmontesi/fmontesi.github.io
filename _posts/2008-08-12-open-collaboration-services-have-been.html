<a href="http://blog.karlitschek.de/2008/08/akademy-rocks.html">Frank</a>'s <a href="http://www.open-collaboration-services.org/socialdesktop.pdf">talk</a> was great: bringing the community into the KDE desktop is actually a great idea.<br />Even better, he's building up REST services for accessing the data! Of course, as we're speaking of services, my mind went directly to "Hey, these things are Joliable".<br /><br />I've already started collaborating with Frank in order to discuss the API and a set of specifications for publishing a machine-readable format for reaching said services.<br /><br />While I'm at it, someone could wonder "Just how difficult is to use these things with JOLIE?". The answer, of course, is <a href="http://jolie.sourceforge.net/videos/jolie-open-collaboration-services.mpeg">"damn easy" (screencast)</a>. ;)<br /><br />So, once we're finished with the JOLIE<->Plasma integration, expect nice graphical frontends to pop up. =)
