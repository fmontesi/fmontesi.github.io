JOLIE has a new and shiny website: <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/">www.jolie-lang.org</a><br /><br />The new site has a wiki which we are filling in with a lot of information, minute by minute. Some tutorials are already final and we are preparing demos and packages of source code examples.<br /><br />This step required some effort and time, but we now have a serious and stable basis to build our  knowledge base upon (the backend of the website is quite powerful and allows for easy administration and data versioning).<br /><br />The mailing list and IRC channel are already active since some time, respectively jolie-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and #jolie on freenode, providing the means for asking about anything related to JOLIE and getting the attention of the JOLIE team.
