For everyone using Windows out there: <span style="font-weight:bold;">compiling JOLIE from sources in Windows is not a pain anymore</span>!<br /><br />I've patched the build system so that it recognizes the running operating system and installs the appropriate launcher script (a shell script in *nix and a .bat script in Windows), so now having a working environment is far less "manual" than before. You can find the updated guide <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/download.php">here</a> (Windows -> From sources).
