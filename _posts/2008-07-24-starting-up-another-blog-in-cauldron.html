Hello, readers.<br />So here I am, another piece in the blogosphere. This blog will be about the development of <a href="http://jolie.sourceforge.net/">JOLIE</a>, a language for service-oriented programming, and all of its related works.<br /><br />As of this first post, this blog is on Planet KDE; the following says why.<br /><br />If you read the planet, you should have seen JOLIE cited here and there already. Basically I'm on Planet KDE because we, the JOLIE and KDE (Plasma especially) projects, are cooperating in order to bring the power of service-oriented computing (see also: service-oriented architecture, service-oriented programming, etc.) to the desktop.<br />This blog of mine is here also to explain what this means and will mean for the KDE desktop, and to show the practical results of this effort. Stay tuned with my blog if you want to know more!
