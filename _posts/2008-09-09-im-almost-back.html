After three weeks full of time eating monsters (scary!) here and there, here I am back to posting.<br /><br />Sorry to people who mailed me in this period, some mails I could not answer to or I missed because my life kept me <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> busy during last weeks. I'll try to reply asap.<br /><br />Fortunately, this week looks good so far, so I'll be back blogging JOLIE news soon!<br /><br />Meanwhile, if someone has ideas for cool plasmoids making use of <a href="http://www.open-collaboration-services.org/">open collaboration services</a> (apart those already listed in the specs draft of course) and/or knows something about how <a href="http://wiki.openid.net/REST/SOAP/HTTP_Bindings">this work</a> is proceeding, please let us know.
