The title of this blog post really leaves a trail of mistery.<br /><br />Today, under a not-so-excellent-but-still-not-too-bad weather, I've decided to enter the dark school of packaging. The results can be found here: <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fmontesi/openSUSE_11.1/">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fmontesi/openSUSE_11.1/</a><br /><br />This means that now we've got a <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fmontesi/openSUSE_11.1/jolie.ymp">one-click installer</a> for <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/">Jolie</a> in openSUSE 11.1. Enjoy!<br /><br />P.S.: in the <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/download.php">website official download page</a> there's a better looking button ;)<br /><br /><strong>Update:</strong> andred in #plasma made me notice that many people are still using openSUSE 11.0. Jolie should work flawlessly even there, but I've got no mean to test it. Anyway, <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fmontesi/">my repository</a> now contains packages for openSUSE 11.0 and openSUSE factory, too. I must say that openSUSE build service is one fantastic piece of software!
