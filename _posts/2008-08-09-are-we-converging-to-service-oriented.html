The more I speak with people at Akademy, the more I'm convinced that contacting KDE to start the JOLIE<->Plasma integration thing has been the right decision.<br /><br />It looks like the whole KDE community (users and developers) is a perfect match to start "porting service-oriented computing to the masses". There is an incredible need for integration, communication, sharing and service accessibility. And when I see talks like the one given by Frank Karlitschek (KDE Community websites: The past, the present and a vision for the future) I get the feeling that we are all trying to converge to a service-oriented experience. We have the right tools, let's make that happen!<br /><br />I do really hope to clarify <span style="font-style: italic;">what</span> this means and <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>we can do it with my presentation this afternoon, so... here I am checking that the demos are still working. Murphy's law, begone! ;)
