I'm flying to Akademy as I'm writing this post (but I'll be able to post it only when I'll be there).<br />Just turned on my laptop to have a look at my presentation, and.. surprise surprise, with KDE 4.1 my battery actually can last 20 minutes longer than with KDE 3.5. Plasma drains almost no power. Hooray for KDE 4!<br /><br />On the other side, my flight switch in Munich was not so easy... did it ever occur to you that your flying company "does not really know if your flight has been cancelled or not" ? =)
