I have just discovered that Simone (Demo) Gentili is documenting his journey about the <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/">Jolie language</a>&nbsp;on his blog! As a matter of fact, he's practically translating the Jolie language tutorials in italian!<br />See <a href="http://www.unodeitanti.com/wordpress/jolie/">his blog here</a> if you are interested in some Jolie lessons in italian.<br /><br />This is obviously a very nice surprise for us and an important form of contribution, so thank you Simone for your work!
