It is some time that I'm thinking about Akademy 2009, and how to make people aware of the potential the integration of Plasma and <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org">Jolie</a> are going to bring. The following is what I came up with, and from some early discussions it really looks like something worth doing. Please share your thoughts and comments on this.<br /><br />The idea is to make a (workshop-like) session about the service-oriented world, with pragmatism in mind. aseigo and ervin have been coerced into helping. It'd be composed by two parts, training and hacking.<br /><br /><h2>Training</h2><br />The training part would touch these topics (not necessarily in order):<br />- the Service-Oriented Computing paradigm: what is it, and how can we use it?<br />- how to exploit the service-oriented paradigm through the Jolie language.<br />- bridging Jolie and Qt with kevin's latest cool library<br />- the Plasma::Service+MetaService API explained. Service-oriented plasmoids!<br />- how to make powerful service compositors/orchestrators in Jolie, and use them as backends for plasmoids or $insert_your_app_here.<br />- use cases and surprises (?)<br />- questions and answers<br /><br /><h2>Hacking</h2><br />Everyone starts his editor of choice and starts hacking on some service-oriented UI/Plasmoid/etc, getting help and sharing ideas.<br />It will be an excellent occasion to improve the framework too (not only the C++ libraries but even the Jolie framework itself, as I'll be there), as there will probably be necessities that could be implemented as a Jolie protocol or some other extension.<br /><br /><br /><br />What I'd like to have are ideas and comments about this. Is there any topic you'd like to be covered in particular? Questions to be answered?<br /><br />Of course it would be nice to have plasma developers attending, along with any other people interested in integrating jolie/service-oriented computing in their application or framework.<br />It'<br /><br />So, dear reader, would *you* attend? =)
