```

Download the `serve` script and set it as executable.

```
wget https://rawgit.com/jolie/leonardo/master/cmd/serve/serve && chmod +x serve
```

# Use

Syntax: `serve [path] [-p TCP_PORT]` where the default `path` is `.` and the default `TCP_PORT` is `8080`.

## Examples

Serve the current directory: `serve`

Serve directory `web`: `serve web`

Serve directory `web` on port `8000`: `serve web 8000`
